#summary Definitions of Common Terms and Some Simple Shape Measurements.

_The following are some important terms associated with shape description:_
  * Major axis: the straight line segment joining the two points on the boundary furthest away fr
each other.
  * Minor axis: the straight line perpendicular to the major axis, and of such length that a rectang
with sides parallel to major and minor axes that just encloses the boundary can be formed using the lengths of the major and minor axes.
  * Basic rectangle: the above rectangle formed with the major and minor axes as its two sides is 
called the basic rectangle.
  * Eccentricity: the ratio of the major to the minor axis is called eccentricity of the boundary.
The above shape measurements provide a rough shape representation. Thus they can be used for 
shape indexing and retrieval. However, as they alone don't describe shape adequately, they are 
normally used together with other shape representations. For example, the Query By Image 
Contents (QBIC1) system of IBM uses shape area, circularity, orientation of the major axis, and 
moment invariants for shape indexing and retrieval [5].
